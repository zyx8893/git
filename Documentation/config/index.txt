index.threads::
	Specifies the number of threads to spawn when loading the index.
	This is meant to reduce index load time on multiprocessor machines.
	Specifying 0 or 'true' will cause Git to auto-detect the number of
	CPU's and set the number of threads accordingly. Specifying 1 or
	'false' will disable multithreading. Defaults to 'true'.

index.version::
	Specify the version with which new index files should be
	initialized.  This does not affect existing repositories.
